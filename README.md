# PHunt
Python first-order approximation to the PromoterHunter code.

This is a simple Python implementation of the  [PromoterHunter](http://www.phisite.org/main/index.php?nav=tools&nav_sel=hunter) tool, for inclusion into Python pipelines. 

It is implemented as Jupyter Notebook for ease of testing, but the functions can be plucked into Python code without loss of generality.

Example files, as well as the original  [PromoterHunter](http://www.phisite.org/main/index.php?nav=tools&nav_sel=hunter) code are provided for reference.
